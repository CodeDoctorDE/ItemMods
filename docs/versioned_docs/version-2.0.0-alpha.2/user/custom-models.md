:::note To have custom models, you need to have a pack.

Click [here](pack.md#create-a-pack) to see how you can create one.

:::

## Create a custom model

* Go to the model list in the pack gui
* Click on the knowledge book
* Give it a name
* Go to the data gui
* Change the default variation or add your own variation to the texture by clicking on the knowledge book
* You can choose where the model file is located. File or internet:
    * If you choose file, you need to add the texture file in plugins/ItemMods/temp
        * Now you need to enter the file name, for example `ruby.json`
    * If you choose internet, you need the direct link to the json
        * If you choose it, please add `.json` to the url, for example `https://example.com/YOURFILE.json`

:::caution You need to export the resource pack before having a custom model.
