A pack is a collection of blocks, items, models, textures and more.

## Create a pack

* Run `/itemmods`
* Click on the pack icon
* Click on the knowledge book and give a name. The name should only have a-z, - and _.
* Done

Now you can create [custom items](custom-items.md), [custom blocks](custom-blocks.md) and more...

## Share the pack

* Go to the pack gui
* Open the manage gui
* Click on export
* Now you should have a zip file with the same name as the pack in the temp folder

This archive can you send with a description in our #share channel in the discord server.
