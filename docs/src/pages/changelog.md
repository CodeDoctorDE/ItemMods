# Changelog

## 2.0.0-alpha.0

I rewrote the plugin. 
Here are the highlights:

* Every item and block is in a pack and have its own file in the pack directory
* GUI improvements: tabs, smaller gui, ...
* Resource pack generator: The plugin will build a resource pack for you. 
  You only need to add a preset, and the required textures
* New translation api: It's easier to translate. I added crowdin to give the opinion
  to add their own language to the plugin
* New docs: I created an own website for the plugin. Here you can see all news, documentation and more
* Remove nms dependency, added craftbukkit dependency. You don't need to wait for a new itemmods version
  if mojang released a new minecraft version
* Follow the semantic versioning 2.0: Every version is named in the following schema: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
  The alpha, beta and release candidates has a number after it (for example 2.0.0-alpha.0)
  
And here is the first release in 2021 for ItemMods!
Have fun. The docs are not finished, so please use the discord for questions.

Thanks for waiting :)
