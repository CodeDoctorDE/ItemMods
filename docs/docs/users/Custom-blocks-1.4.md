# Step 1: Create a block

* Once you have both the ruby ore and ruby item do /itemmods and click this button

* After you clicked that click create. This will start you creating a new block
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.48.12.png)

* It will make you type in a name of your block, so just do that when it says to. When you typed in the name of your block click the armor stand to enable it.

* After that place the block that you want your custom block to share properties with somewhere near you. In this case I want my ruby ore to act like emerald ore

* Once it is placed do /itemmods again, and click the block template button in the block editing menu
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.50.23.png)

* Then just break the block you had placed earlier and it will set that as your template block
* Once you have done that click the wooden planks to open the armor stand menu

* Select the ruby ore block (or whatever your custom block is)
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.50.39.png)

* And drop it on the barrier item underneath the helmet
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.50.42.png)

* The armor stand is invisible but I like disabling the baseplate (the little plate that the armor stand spawns on) so that the block looks nice and clean. This is up to you.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.50.48.png)

* Click save (the green dye in the top right corner) in the armor stand menu and then click back until you get to this menu again. 

# Step 2: Create an item for the block

* Click Item to start creating the actual item (the block item not the item that drops)
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.51.08.png)

* After that you need to click on create to start creating a new item
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.51.11.png)

* It should have prompted you to type in the name of the item. You can do the same name as what you typed earlier it doesn't really matter. After you type in the name click the new item that you just created
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.51.26.png)

* After you clicked that it should take you to this menu. Right now there is no item set for it.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.51.34.png)

* Drag and drop your ruby ore block onto the barrier item (you will have to have given yourself multiple back when you had to do the give command)

# Step 3: Connect the item with the block

* After that click the ender chest (this is where you are going to select the template you made earlier)
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.51.49.png)

* Click the ItemMods beacon (This is just telling it to use the features from this plugin, in case you have other addons installed)
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.51.51.png)
* After you click the beacon there should be another block that appears. I didn't take screenshots, but if your template block you made earlier didn't appear just click whatever pops up.
* It will take you back to where the ender chest is again. Click it.
* again
* After you click the ender chest again you will see all of your block templates you had made before (I made 2 blocks before you should only see the 1 that you made) Click the template you want.

* Now you should have a block that can be placed but it wont drop anything. Click the gold nugget at the bottom right of the item editor.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.54.13.png)

* Click the give button at the bottom right. This will give you your block.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.54.16.png)

* Now you have a block that can be placed and broken, but it won't drop anything.

# Step 4: Changing the drop

* To add drops go back to the main menu and click the block button again.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.48.09.png)

* Select the template of the block you just made
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.52.53.png)

* At the bottom middle there is a button called drops. Click it
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.52.55.png)

* Click create. This will prompt you to drop the item that you want to be added as a drop, so make sure you have your custom ruby in your inventory before you click it.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.52.57.png)

* When this happens just drop your ruby by pressing q while holding it
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.53.35.png)

* Now it should be added. You could quit here, but your ruby will still be named emerald. Click the item to open up its editing menu.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.53.45.png)

* After you clicked the ruby item it will take you to this menu. Click the nametag to change its display name.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.53.47.png)

* Type in the name of your drop. This is what your players will see when the have it in their inventory.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.53.51.png)

* Click submit. Now everything is finished.
![Screenshot ingame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/develop/assets/2020-08-22_09.54.01.png)

* You can go back to the item menu and give yourself more of the blocks. Now when they are broken they will drop your custom item.
