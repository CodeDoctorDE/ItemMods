1. First, download my plugin :)
2. I have a sample texture pack for you where I create an example ruby ore: <https://github.com/CodeDoctorDE/ItemMods/raw/master/%C2%A76ItemMods%20Sample%20Texturepack.zip>
3. Put it as a server resource pack or as normal resourcepack in `%APPDATA%/.minecraft/resourecpacks`
4. There is a ruby ore. You get it with the command `/give @p minecraft:emerald_ore{CustomModelData:1}`
5. Open the plugin menu with /itemmods
6. Click on the blocks list item . Then on the knowledge book to create a new item
