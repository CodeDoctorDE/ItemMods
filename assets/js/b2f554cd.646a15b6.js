Happy birthday! Come to [the discord](https://go.linwood.dev/itemmods-discord) to\\ncelebrate this!\\nI rewrote the plugin.\\n\\nHere are the highlights:\\n\\n* Every item and block is in a pack and have its own file in the pack directory\\n* GUI improvements: tabs, smaller gui, ...\\n* Resource pack generator: The plugin will build a resource pack for you. You only need to add a preset, and the\\n  required textures\\n* New translation api: It\'s easier to translate. I added crowdin to give the opinion to add their own language to the\\n  plugin\\n* New docs: I created an own website for the plugin. Here you can see all news, documentation and more. See\\n  it [here](https://itemmods.linwood.dev)\\n* Remove nms dependency, added nbt api\\n* Follow the semantic versioning 2.0: Every version is named in the following schema: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The alpha, beta\\n  and release candidates has a number after it (for example 2.0.0-alpha.0)\\n\\nAnd here is the first release in 2021 for ItemMods!\\nHave fun. The docs are not finished, so please use the discord for questions.\\n\\nThank you for waiting :)"}]}')}}]);
